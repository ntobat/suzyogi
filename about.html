	<p>Hi, I’m Suzy.<br><br>I’m a yoga teacher and a citizen of the universe. I love to eat fresh blackberries, find spontaneous adventure, sink into savasana, and I always take in the view.<br><br>I truly believe that by living a thoughtful life one can begin to break down the ego and its archetypes that can dull our inner light. I have found that yoga is the greatest vehicle for change. By practicing yoga and becoming sensitive to the beats and rhythms of our realms, purpose becomes blindingly obvious and a gentle guide allows us to find our sense of flow. Anyone can access the life they truly desire. My passion lies with helping people get there.<br><br>My practice includes all 8 limbs of yoga and embraces all yoga traditions and teachings. I always come to class with a new and unique sequence, sometimes making tweaks on the fly, adjusting according to my students' needs. My classes are challenging power vinyasa sequences with playful transitions, emphasis on the breath, and modifications to make the practice accessible to all yogis. I hope to free your inner sense of childish play and exploration while meeting your expectations of increased strength, flexibility, and awareness.<br><br>I teach group classes and workshops around the world. I have designed programs for athletes, newbie and expert yogis, victims of sexual assault, children, and people with special needs. I am honored to be a yoga teacher and a part of my students’ journeys toward physical and mental wellness.<br><br>Join in on the fun by checking out my <a href="schedule.html" class="link">schedule</a>. For daily doings find me on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/suzyogi" class="link">instagram</a>. Interested in a private session? <a href="contact.html" class="link">Email me</a> for schedule and availability.<br><br>Peace and Blessings to all.</p>

		<li><p>“We already have everything we need. There is no need for self improvement. All these trips we lay on ourselves, the identities that we cling so dearly to, they never touch our basic wealth. They are like clouds that temporarily block the sun. But all our earth and brilliance are right there. This is who we really are. We are one blink of an eye from being fully awake.”<br><span class="author"> - Pema Choden</span></p></li>
		<li><p>“Be not afraid. It’s truly the secret of life. Fear is what stunts our growth, narrows our ambitions, kills our dreams. So fear not.”<br><span class="author"> - Anna Quindlen</span></p></li>
		<li><p>“Fear can be experienced only when one pretends they’re not in control.”<br><span class="author"> - The Universe</span></p></li>
		<li><p>“Out beyond our ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' doesn’t make any sense.”<br><span class="author"> - Mevlana Jelaluddin Rumi</span></p></li>
